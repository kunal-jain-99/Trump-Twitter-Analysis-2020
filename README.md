# Trump-Twitter-Analysis-2020
President Donald J. Trump's Twitter Analysis with tweets from 1st January 2020 to 16th August 2020.

**Data Source:** *http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/*
**Analysis done using:** *Tableau*

######Analysis:
1. Tweets from January 2020
2. Mr. President's Favourite Words
3. Top 10 Retweeted Tweets
4. Top 10 Favourite Tweets

**Note:**
> Twitter returns a tweet's timestamp in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and the datasource translates that to Eastern Standard Time, which is 5 hours behind. Unfortunately, not all tweets come with location data, so the data source provider is unable to further translate a tweet 3 more hours behind if tweeted from California (PST). It's an imperfect system, but likely the most accurate. So, you may face some problems when you store the data in Excel and then use it in Tableau.
I recommend extracting the data into a text file and then use this text file in Tableau.
